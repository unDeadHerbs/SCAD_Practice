* Library Examples
** Maths and Programming
*** =sum=
The =sum= function takes a list of things and returns their sum.
*** =pop=
=pop= takes a list and returns it without the current last element.
*** =take=
=take= takes a count and a list and returns that many elments from the
list.
*** =count_defined=
=count_defined= takes a list and returns how many non-=undef= elements
it contains.
*** =any=
=any= takes a list and returns a non-=undef= element from it.
*** =unique=
=unique= takes a list, checks that there is only one non-=undef=
element in the list, and returns it, also takes an optional error
message.
** Geometry
*** =outer_glue= (Under Development)
Take a list of children and attaches them to each other while trying
to maintain important facets.

**** Usage Notes
This is sensitive to ordering, the features of the elements are added
in the order provided.  Try to add simple parts to a central "core"
order from "inside" to "outside".

*** =pair=
Take an argument object and make two of it.  The two objects can be
rotated, reflected, or translated.

The functions =xpair=, =ypair=, and =zpair= exist to simplify the
readability of using code.

There also exists =tripple= which makes a pair and maintains a middle element.
*** =set=
Make a ring of objects.

[[pictures/set_basic.png]]
*** =grid=
Make a grid of an object, the first parameter is a list of step sizes,
the second is a count of steps.

*** =up=, =down=, =right=, =left=, =forward=, and =back=
These are short functions that return a vector in the desired
direction and amount.
*** =Cube=
This is a rewrite of =cube= that let you center only along one axis.
*** TODO =Mirror=
*** TODO =parallelepiped=
Make some pretty vectors here to describe the shape
*** =annulus=
An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus][annulus]] is a a ring or doughnut shape.  
#+begin_src SCAD
  $fn=100;
  use <../../lib.scad>

  render(){
  	annulus(ro=10,
  		ri=5,
  		t=5,
  		theta=30,
  		cut_symmetric=true);}
#+end_src

Here is a sweep of some shapes it can make.

And here's a static sampling.

**** TODO Bugs and Future Features
- [ ] Fix the edge of the =tanget_cut= version.
- [ ] Fix the angle mesures used in =tanget_cut=.
- [ ] Accept a 2D profile shape.
