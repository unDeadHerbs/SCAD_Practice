** Maths and Programming
*** =sum=
The =sum= function takes a list of things and returns their sum.
*** =pop=
=pop= takes a list and returns it without the current last element.
*** =take=
=take= takes a count and a list and returns that many elments from the
list.
*** =count_defined=
=count_defined= takes a list and returns how many non-=undef= elements
it contains.
*** =any=
=any= takes a list and returns a non-=undef= element from it.
*** =unique=
=unique= takes a list, checks that there is only one non-=undef=
element in the list, and returns it, also takes an optional error
message.
** Geometry
*** =outer_glue= (Under Development)
Take a list of children and attaches them to each other while trying
to maintain important facets.

**** Usage Notes
This is sensitive to ordering, the features of the elements are added
in the order provided.  Add simple parts in order from "inside" to
"outside".

*** =annulus=
An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus][annulus]] is a a ring or doughnut shape.  
#+begin_src SCAD
  $fn=100;
  use <../../lib.scad>

  annulus(ro=10,
  	ri=5,
  	t=5,
  	theta=30,
  	cut_symmetric=true);

**** TODO Bugs and Future Features
- [ ] Fix the edge of the =tanget_cut= version.
- [ ] Fix the angle mesures used in =tanget_cut=.
- [ ] Accept a 2D profile shape.
